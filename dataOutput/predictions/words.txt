P1
and
earlier
contains
a
stored
cross
-
site
scripting
vulnerability
.
A
malicious
Operations
Console
administrator
could
potentially
exploit
this
vulnerability
to
store
arbitrary
HTML
or
JavaScript
code
through
the
web
interface
.
When
other
Operations
Console
administrators
open
the
affected
page
the
injected
scripts
could
potentially
be
executed
in
their
browser
.
The
vulnerability
is
due
to
insufficient
CSRF
protections
for
the
web
-
based
management
interface
of
the
affected
device
.
An
attacker
could
exploit
this
vulnerability
by
persuading
a
user
of
the
interface
to
follow
a
malicious
link
.
A
successful
exploit
could
allow
the
attacker
to
perform
arbitrary
actions
on
the
targeted
device
via
a
