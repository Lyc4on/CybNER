The loader would then download the pwnRig crpytominer and an IRC bot that runs commands from a  command-and-control (C2) server. It would then maintain persistence by creating either a cronjob or a script running every 60 seconds as nohup.

"/u/SV2MG what are these exploits? i've found a couple of papers from cybersecurity researchers where they were able to deanonymize some users, but they are from several years ago. I2P has regular updates to try to fix those issues, plus i have I2P on a workstation that is funneled through a Whonix gateway, so even if i am a victim of I2P deanonymization, the adversary would have to then go through tor to get to me.

Lokinet is pretty cool too, i haven't played with it at all yet but from what i have read, its clear to me that its the next step in evolution Tor should go. Onion routing certainly powerful, and it being more decentralized than Tor/allows UDP traffic is a huge plus. But in my opinion garlic routing is superior to onion routing. If every Tor user switched to I2P and used Tor as a backup like i do, we're almost unstoppable.

"Contrary to what many might be inclined to suspect, publicly accessible Tor bridges were only ever designed with the intent in mind to attempt the evasion of Tor entry guard blocking and blacklisting by blanketing, unsophisticated network-wide firewall mechanisms. They were never intended, as many believe, to securely hide the use of Tor from a sophisticated actor performing targeted eavesdropping on specific traffic with the goal in-mind of identifying probable Tor traffic. 

The reality is, for Tor users who aren't connecting through a network that censors Tor traffic, using public bridges actually doesn't provide any added level of anonymity or security to one's connection, and may actually come with added risks.

"The plan is to start it out as a DDoS botnet, since sending packets towards directed targets in the background, I feel, would be the easiest ""test case"" in creating an initial botnet. Then deploy an update across the botnet to have it begin doing new tasks. Botnet for mining XMR, keylogging bank details, etc. Then either rent out the botnet or sell the controller off to someone else, depending on if I want to keep it after getting it to a decent point, or if I want to cash out to avoid drawing attention to myself in the long term. Windows would probably be my direct target, since that's so widespread with so many vulnerabilities. Plus, if IoT isn't some hacking term that means something other than ""Internet of Things"", don't wanna risk putting something out there with a chance to turn physically harmful.",

"Depending on the target you hit, if it's a giant, be sure they have Intrusion Detection Systems in place. There are devices that come before the load balancer that detect your packet and if it doesn't look like its going for destination port, destination source 443 then it's a no go. Using deep packet inspection they can find anomalies that will tell them inside this encrypted packet is another encrypted packet so either your MTU is too large and you get fragmentation or it's too small and it triggers a VPN sizing down each packet below 1500 MTU.

"An RDP is just a hacked computer you can control (RDP stands for Remote Desktop Protocol.)

Then you would be able to completely disable telemetry. Become the owner of key files that are currently run as services. Block the host from leaking anything at all.


Unfortunately, a post won't do it. It involves labor (time) and technical familiarity but it is completely possible.

If you have never used GNU/Linux, then start with Ubuntu or possibly a lighter version like Lubuntu, because generic Ubuntu ships with a lot of unnecessary stuff.The installation is real easy, and it is probably the most user friendly. If you are going to use Ubuntu or some variant to do your work, I'd recommend installing it on an external SSD or flash drive and booting from it instead of your main OS.

For years, reverse engineers and endpoint security software have used memory scanning to locate shellcode and malware implants in Windows memory. These tools rely on IOCs such as signatures and unbacked executable memory. This talk will dive into the various methods in which memory scanners search for these indicators and demonstrate a stable evasion technique for each method. A new position-independent reflective DLL loader, AceLdr, will be released alongside the presentation and features the demonstrated techniques to evade all of the previously described memory scanners. The presenter and their colleagues have used AceLdr on red team operations against mature security programs to avoid detection successfully.


This talk will focus on the internals of PE-sieve, MalMemDetect, Moneta, Volatility malfind, and YARA to understand how they find malware in memory and how malware can be modified to fly under their radar consistently.

We will describe how engineers diagnose PLC issues, write code, and transfer bytecode to PLCs for execution with industrial processes in any number of critical sectors, including electric, water and wastewater, heavy industry, and automotive manufacturing. 

The research resulted in working PoCs against ICS market leaders which fixed all the reported vulnerabilities and remediated the attack vector. Such vendors include Rockwell Automation, Schneider Electric, GE, B&R, Xinje, OVARRO and more.",
