"Nobelium continued to experiment with multiple variations. In one wave, no ISO payload was delivered at all. Instead, a Nobelium-controlled web server profiled the target device. In the event the targeted device was an iPhone or iPad, a server delivered what was then a zero-day exploit for CVE-2021-1879, an iOS vulnerability that allowed hackers to deliver a universal cross-site scripting attack. Apple patched the zero-day in late March.",https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/microsoft-says-solarwinds-hackers-targeted-us-agencies-in-a-new-campaign/
"""Though the SolarWinds activity was remarkable for its stealth and discipline, loud, broad spearphishing operations were once the calling card of SVR operators who often carried out noisy phishing campaigns,"" John Hultquist, Vice President of Analysis at FireEye-owned Mandiant Threat Intelligence, said in an email. ""Those operations were often effective, gaining access to major government offices among other targets. And while the spear phishing emails were quickly identified, we expect that any post-compromise actions by these actors would be highly skilled and stealthy.""

"“A vulnerability in the cluster database API of Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence VCS could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with Administrator read-write privileges on the application to conduct absolute path traversal attacks on an affected device and overwrite files on the underlying operating system as a root user,” read the advisory.",https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/cisco-releases-ten-security-patches/
A reverse proxy server is a type of proxy server that typically sits behind the firewall in a private network and directs client requests to the appropriate backend server.,
“An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the system as an administrative read-write user and submitting crafted input to the affected command.”,https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/cisco-releases-ten-security-patches/

"“After initial access, a loader is downloaded,” explained the security experts. “This loader evades detection by clearing log files and disabling cloud monitoring and security tools. Tamper protection capabilities in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint help protect security settings.”",
,
The loader would then download the pwnRig crpytominer and an IRC bot that runs commands from a  command-and-control (C2) server. It would then maintain persistence by creating either a cronjob or a script running every 60 seconds as nohup.,
,
"According to Microsoft, the malware also features self-propagating capabilities.",
“The loader uses the IP port scanner tool ‘masscan’ to find other SSH servers in the network and then uses the GoLang-based SSH brute force tool ‘spirit’ to propagate. It also scans the local disk for SSH keys to move laterally by connecting to known hosts.”,
,
"To protect networks against this threat, Microsoft said organizations should secure systems and servers, apply updates, and use good credential hygiene.",

“Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Linux detects malicious behaviors and payloads related to this campaign.”,
I would recommend Office files... and then use a macro to run an exploit or maybe take a look at CVE-2022-30190... it wont work on OSX because it uses ms-msdt protocol but you may be able to use something similar to get your exploit on the target. Sadly I'm not an expert on exploiting OSX so you may have to figure something out yourself. If you know which OSX version the victim is running you may be able to find some vulnerabilities for the specific version.,http://dread5pjihquldyuc4s47yrjqm5ozkpk55mbyfwtqfgqvmycw4dqpnqd.onion/search/?q=exploit
I could get one of my own keyloggers and test if it runs smoothly on OSX if you want to. If it really has to be a full rootkit you may just look into Metasploit and find something that works for your purposes.,
,
And yes the victim CAN do a lot to get rid of it... Every antivirus can put the program into quarantine or remove it entirely from the system or the victim may take a look into taskmanager and then stops the program or restarts their device which is enough if you haven't build a good persistence. (While researching for your issue I found a very nice paper about MacOS malware persistence. PM me if you want to read it),

"Malware typically only starts executing when it is executed by the user, there are exceptions though (zero-click exploits don't require any user action for instance). Malware can spread around a network, however it would find an attack surface, in order to spread to other devices. If you believe your computer has been infected, I suggest you completely wipe it, as this is the only way to be absolutely sure it is clean. Also wipe any USB or disk you had connected after/during the infection. There is no way to be sure you have been infected though. If a malware is crafted carefully, it will not reveal itself to the user, in fact that's the goal.",
"/u/SV2MG what are these exploits? i've found a couple of papers from cybersecurity researchers where they were able to deanonymize some users, but they are from several years ago. I2P has regular updates to try to fix those issues, plus i have I2P on a workstation that is funneled through a Whonix gateway, so even if i am a victim of I2P deanonymization, the adversary would have to then go through tor to get to me.",

"Lokinet is pretty cool too, i haven't played with it at all yet but from what i have read, its clear to me that its the next step in evolution Tor should go. Onion routing certainly powerful, and it being more decentralized than Tor/allows UDP traffic is a huge plus. But in my opinion garlic routing is superior to onion routing. If every Tor user switched to I2P and used Tor as a backup like i do, we're almost unstoppable.",

"just because a system doesn't treat you like a kid and have a popup every time a suspicious file comes up or doesnt do extensive damage control for malware doesn't mean it isn't secure. If the user is competent, Linux is fairly secure, but I concede GrapheneOS is the most secure OS. ",
"So, the thing about hosting your own Tor bridge on a VPS or some other form of data host is that all the traffic you would pass through the host's infrastructure that they would in-theory be able to sell or otherwise exploit would be torified, meaning that it would in its entirety be both private and anonymous from their perspective. That's not to say though that there couldn't be valuable metadata that could be gleaned from your traffic by the hosting provider that could be of value to a sophisticated, dedicated adversary, such as the time that certain connections happened and the quantity of data passing through the node at given intervals.",http://dread5pjihquldyuc4s47yrjqm5ozkpk55mbyfwtqfgqvmycw4dqpnqd.onion/search/?p=9&q=exploit
