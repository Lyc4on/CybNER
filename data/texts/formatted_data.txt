{"sentence": "Nobelium continued to experiment with multiple variations. In one wave, no ISO payload was delivered at all. Instead, a Nobelium-controlled web server profiled the target device. In the event the targeted device was an iPhone or iPad, a server delivered what was then a zero-day exploit for CVE-2021-1879, an iOS vulnerability that allowed hackers to deliver a universal cross-site scripting attack. Apple patched the zero-day in late March.\"Though the SolarWinds activity was remarkable for its stealth and discipline, loud, broad spearphishing operations were once the calling card of SVR operators who often carried out noisy phishing campaigns,\" John Hultquist, Vice President of Analysis at FireEye-owned Mandiant Threat Intelligence, said in an email. \"Those operations were often effective, gaining access to major government offices among other targets. And while the spear phishing emails were quickly identified, we expect that any post-compromise actions by these actors would be highly skilled and stealthy.\"A separate post published by the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center, or MSTIC, said the backdoor allowed Nobelium to achieve persistent access to compromised machines so the group could “conduct action-on objectives, such as lateral movement, data exfiltration, and delivery of additional malware.”Tuesday’s attack was just the latest wave of what MSTIC said was a widespread malicious spam campaign that started in late January. Since then, the campaign has evolved in a series of iterations that have demonstrated “significant experimentation.”When Microsoft first saw the campaign, it was hosting the ISO on Firebase, a Google-owned cloud platform for mobile and Web apps. During this early iteration, Microsoft said, the ISO image contained no malicious payload, leading company researchers to conclude the purpose was to “record attributes of those who accessed the URL.” When opened, JavaScript wrote an ISO image to disc and encouraged the target to open it.10 years in the career and at an Assoc. Director level and I’m constantly learning new things. Adversaries are always coming up with new ways to break into/compromise systems.“Microsoft security researchers assess that the Nobelium’s spear-phishing operations are recurring and have increased in frequency and scope,” the MSTC post concluded. “It is anticipated that additional activity may be carried out by the group using an evolving set of tactics.”“A vulnerability in the cluster database API of Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence VCS could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with Administrator read-write privileges on the application to conduct absolute path traversal attacks on an affected device and overwrite files on the underlying operating system as a root user,” read the advisory.A reverse proxy server is a type of proxy server that typically sits behind the firewall in a private network and directs client requests to the appropriate backend server.“An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the system as an administrative read-write user and submitting crafted input to the affected command.”"}
